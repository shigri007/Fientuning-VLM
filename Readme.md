## **Project Overview**

This project trains and evaluates an object detection model leveraging **Florence-2**, a multimodal model, fine-tuned using **LoRA** to improve accuracy and reduce computational costs. The model processes image-text pairs and predicts bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects.  

**Core Objective:**  
To achieve high accuracy in object detection using a computationally efficient approach with fine-tuning on custom datasets.

---

## **Features**

- Fine-tuning with **LoRA** for parameter-efficient training.  
- **Custom Dataset Loader**: Supports loading `.jsonl` annotations and images.  
- Real-time inference with bounding box rendering.  
- Training and evaluation pipelines with visualization tools.  
- Automatic plotting of training and validation loss over epochs.  

---

## **Installation**

### **Requirements**

- Python 3.10
- CUDA-enabled GPU (optional but recommended)
- Required Python libraries:
  - `torch`
  - `transformers`
  - `supervision`
  - `peft`
  - `roboflow`
  - `matplotlib`

### **Setup**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone repo link
   cd 
   ```
   Alternatively, download the model manually from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Configure your GPU:
   - Set the `DEVICE` in your code to `cuda:X` where `X` is your GPU ID.

4. Set up your Roboflow API key in the code or environment variables.

## **Usage**

### **Dataset Preparation**

1. Use [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) to download the dataset. Ensure the dataset includes `.jsonl` annotation files for training and validation subsets.
2. Place the dataset in a directory, structured as follows:
   ```
   dataset/
   ├── train/
   │   ├── annotations.jsonl
   │   └── images/
   ├── valid/
   │   ├── annotations.jsonl
   │   └── images/
   ```

3. Update the dataset path in the code:
   ```python
   dataset = version.download("name")
   ```

4. Update the dataset paths in `config.py`:
   ```python
   train_dataset = DetectionDataset(
       jsonl_file_path="/path/to/train/annotations.jsonl",
       image_directory_path="/path/to/train/"
   )
   val_dataset = DetectionDataset(
       jsonl_file_path="/path/to/valid/annotations.jsonl",
       image_directory_path="/path/to/valid/"
   )
   ```

### **Training**

Run the training script:
```bash
python main.py
```
This script will train the model, save the loss plots in the `graphres` directory, and display progress on the console.

---

### **Inference**

To test the inference functionality only, follow these steps:

1. Open `main.py`.
2. Comment out the training block:
   ```python
   # train_model(...)
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

### **Evaluation**

Evaluate the model using validation data:
```bash
python evaluate.py --dataset-path path_to_validation_dataset
```

---

## **Results**

- **Loss Graph**: After training, check the `graphres` directory for the `training_and_validation_loss.png` file.
- **Predictions and Targets**: Console output will display generated predictions and their corresponding classes.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues and Fixes

1. **Module Not Found**  
   Ensure you're running the script from the `project_directory`:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project_directory
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Invalid Dataset Paths**  
   Double-check that dataset paths in `config.py` point to valid directories and files.

3. **CUDA Not Found**  
   If CUDA is not available, switch the device to `CPU` in `config.py`:
   ```python
   DEVICE = torch.device("cpu")
   ```
